                        <p style="font-size: 15px">Hi there! Welcome to our HIT.</p>

                        <p style="font-size: 17px"><strong>In this survey, your task is to write a <span
                                style="color: red">STATE (using a stative verb) such that the ACTION (in red)
                            causes the transition between two STATEs.</span></strong></p>

                        <h3 style="text-align: center">Definition of STATE & ACTION</h3>

                        <p style="font-size: 17px">ACTION describe actions we take (things we do) or things that
                            happen, they usually end in a certain time period and represent a certain action instead of
                            a state.<br>STATE are usually described using stative verbs, they refer to the way things
                            'are'
                            - their appearance, state of being, smell, etc.<br>The most important difference between
                            STATE
                            and ACTION is that action verbs can be used in continuous tenses and stative verbs cannot be
                            used in continuous tenses.</p>

                        <p style="font-size: 15px"><strong>Note that a number of verbs can refer to states or actions,
                            depending on the context.</strong><br> For example:<br>I think it's a good idea.<br> Wait a
                            moment! I'm thinking. </p>

                        <p style="font-size: 15px">The first sentence expresses an opinion. It is a mental state, so we
                            use present simple. In the second example the speaker is actively processing thoughts about
                            something. It is an action in progress, so we use present continuous.</p>

                        <p style="font-size: 15px">Some other examples are:</p>

                        <p style="font-size: 15px">
                            <strong>have</strong><br>
                            I have an old car. (state – possession)<br>
                            I'm having a quick break. (action – having a break is an activity)<br><br>

                            <strong>see</strong><br>
                            Do you see any problems with that? (state – opinion)<br>
                            We're seeing Tadanari tomorrow afternoon. (action – we're meeting him)<br><br>

                            <strong>be</strong><br>
                            He's so interesting! (state – his permanent quality)<br>
                            He's being very unhelpful. (action – he is temporarily behaving this way)<br><br>

                            <strong>taste</strong><br>
                            This coffee tastes delicious. (state – our perception of the coffee)<br>
                            Look! The chef is tasting the soup. (action – tasting the soup is an activity)<br><br></p>

                        <h3 style="color: rebeccapurple">Some Hints</h3>
                        <p style="font-size: 18px">A common way to distinguish a state is that the verbs aren't usually
                            used in the present continuous form. Take the examples below, the cross-lined sentences
                            aren't usually used in English, and those uncross-lined sentences are all describing a
                            state.</p>

                        <blockquote>
                            <p><em>I don't know the answer. <s>I'm not knowing the answer.</s><br/>
                                She really likes you. <s>She's really liking you.</s><br/>
                                He seems happy at the moment. <s>He's seeming happy at the moment.</s></em></p>
                        </blockquote>

                        <h3 style="text-align: center">Fill in the missing STATE</h3>
                        <p>After understanding the difference between STATE and ACTION, your task is to fill in a STATE
                            such that the ACTION marked in red will cause a transition between two STATEs.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>For example:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p><em>PersonX feels hungry,<br/>
                                <span style="color:red;">PersonX eats a hamburger</span><br/>
                                PersonX is happy</em></p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p style="font-size: 15px">PersonX feels hungry and is happy are both STATEs of PersonX, and
                            eating a hamburger is an
                            ACTION taken by PersonX as well. Moreover, PersonX's STATE transit from feeling hungry to
                            happy because he takes the action of eating hamburger. In this way, we say that eating a
                            hamburger causes the transition between feel hungry and is happy.</p>
                        <p style="color:red;">IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT THE GIVEN ACTION IN RED WILL CAUSE THE
                            TRANSITION BETWEEN TWO EVENTS!</p>
                        <p>Some other examples are:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p><em>PersonX is jealous of PersonY,<br/>
                                <span style="color: red">PersonX makes PersonY ill</span>,<br/>
                                PersonY wants to go back to work</em></p><br>
                            <p><em>PersonX is looking for PersonY,<br/>
                                <span style="color: red">PersonX makes a phone call</span>,<br/>
                                PersonX wants PersonY to answer</em></p><br>
                            <p><em>PersonY is thirsty,<br/>
                                <span style="color: red">PersonX makes a pot of coffee</span>,<br/>
                                PersonY wants to drink the coffee</em></p><br>
                        </blockquote>
