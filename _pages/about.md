## About me

Hi there! Welcome to my personal homepage. I'm currently a Year 3 Undergraduate Student in
the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/), pursing a bachelor degree in Computer
Science and Mathematics.

Currently, It's my great honor to work under the supervision of [Professor Song,Yangqiu](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/) at the Knowledge Computation Group in HKUST. At the same time, I greatly appreciate the help offered by my best working mentor/partner: 
[Mr. Tianqing Fang](https://github.com/tqfang) and my best friend in NLP: [Mr. Jiefu Ou](https://github.com/JefferyO). 

## Research Interest

I'm mainly interested in the research of Natural Language Processing, with a special interest in solving the following questions:

### **1. Commonsense Knowledge in Natural Language Processing:**
When human communicates, we rely on a vast background of unspoken assumptions. Everyone knows that "water is wet" and "we need food when we feel hungry", and we assume everyone we meet shares this knowledge. It forms the basis of how we interact and allows us to communicate quickly, efficiently, and with deep meaning.

However, current NLP models mainly relies on the explicit context information provided by some large corpus, how can we build deep learning models to efficiently and accurately learn the commonsense knowledge from large corpus? Even more, how can we achieve a highly adaptive and unsupervised NLP system with the help of commonsense learning?
What is the ultimate way of learning discourse knowledge and commonsense knowledge?

### **2. Information Extraction and Graph Learning with Knowledge Graphs:**
The knowledge graph represents a collection of interlinked descriptions of entities – objects, events or concepts, they put data in context via linking and semantic metadata and this way provide a framework for data integration, unification, analytics and sharing.

With the development of graph algorithms, some graph neural networks demonstrated high performance in learning knowledge graphs. How can we design and implement more complicated graph learning algorithms to better extract the knowledge in different knowledge graphs? And how can we bridge the gap between different knowledge graphs to generate more explicit or discourse knowledge?
Meanwhile, how to construct knowledge graphs that are rich in commonsense knowledge?

### **Beside the above topics, I'm also actively participating researches in:**
* Machine learning based data mining with the combination of other field's knowledge such as environmental and atmospheric data.
