## About me

Hi there! Welcome to my personal homepage. I'm an incoming Ph.D. Student at
the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/) supervised
by [Professor Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/). My research interest lies in the field of commonsense
reasoning and natural language processing. I received my bachelor degree in Computer Science and Mathematics from the
same institution, and I'm now funded by
the [HKPFS](https://fytgs.hkust.edu.hk/scholarships/hong-kong-phd-fellowship-scheme) award.

This webpage is last updated on **2022/7/18**.
