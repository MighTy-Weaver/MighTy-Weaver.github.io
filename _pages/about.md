## About me

Hi there! Welcome to my personal homepage. I'm currently a Final Year Undergraduate Student in
the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/), pursing a bachelor degree in Computer
Science and Mathematics. Starting from Fall 2022, I will be joining [Professor Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/)'s Knowledge Computation Group pursuing a PhD degree in Computer Science and Engineering as a [HKPFS](https://pg.ust.hk/prospective-students/scholarship-fees/hong-kong-phd-fellowship-scheme) holder. 

This webpage is last updated on **2022/4/7**.

## News

- [2022/1/17]    One paper has been accepted to JCLEPRO.
- [2021/8/26]    One paper has been accepted to EMNLP2021 (main conference).
- [2021/1/16]    One paper has been accepted to WWW2021.

## Research Interest

I'm mainly interested in the research of Natural Language Processing, with a special interest in commonsense reasoning
and acquisition. In general, I'm aspired to answer the following questions: How can we build deep learning models to
efficiently and accurately learn the commonsense knowledge from large corpus? How can machine learning models learn the
commonsense related information or attributes behind? What additional information should we provide to deep learning
models for them to capture the commonsense knowledge? What is the ultimate way to realize understanding human language
by machine?

Beside the above topics, I'm also actively participating researches in Machine learning based data mining with the
combination of other field's knowledge such as environmental and atmospheric data.
