## About me

Hi there! Welcome to my personal homepage.
I'm a second year Ph.D. Student in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/) at
the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/) supervised
by [Professor Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/). I received my bachelor degree in Computer Science
and Mathematics from the same institution in 2022, and I'm now funded by
the [HKPFS](https://fytgs.hkust.edu.hk/scholarships/hong-kong-phd-fellowship-scheme) award.
Currently, I'm in the San Francisco Bay Area for my internship at Amazon.com.

## Research Interest

I'm mainly interested in the research of Natural Language Processing. In the era of Large Foundation Models, I'm
actively researching in:

- Towards Robust and Generalizable Reasoning via [*Conceptualization*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.10885) ([üêà](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.733.pdf), [üöó](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.902.pdf), [üïØÔ∏è](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07286.pdf)) and *Metaphysics* ([ü™ê](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02106))
- *Intentional Commonsense Knowledge* Discovery with Large Foundation Models in E-Commerce ([FolkScope](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.76.pdf), [IntentionQA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.10173), [MIND](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.10701), üìÖ) and Social Media ([MIKO](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18169.pdf))
