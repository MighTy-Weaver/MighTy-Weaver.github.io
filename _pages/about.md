## About me

Hi there! Welcome to my personal homepage. I'm currently a Year 3 Undergraduate Student in
the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/), pursing a bachelor degree in Computer
Science and Mathematics. This website is still under construction and more details will be upload once available.

## Research Interest

I'm mainly interested in the research of Natural Language Processing, with a special interest in knowledge graph learning and commonsense extraction, while I'm also trying to know more in the field of Computer Vision. 

Currently, I'm working under the supervison of [Professor Song,Yangqiu](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/). At the same time, I greatly appreciate the help offered by my best working mentor/partner: 
[Mr. Tianqing Fang](https://github.com/tqfang) and the advisor when I was a junior in the NLP field: [Mr. Jiefu Ou](https://github.com/JefferyO). 

Further Research Achievements and Publications will be made available in the future.
