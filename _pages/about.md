## About me

Hi there! Welcome to my personal homepage. I'm currently a Year 3 Undergraduate Student in
the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/), pursing a bachelor degree in Computer
Science and Mathematics. This website is still under construction and more details will be upload once available.

Currently, I'm working under the supervison of [Professor Song,Yangqiu](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/). At the same time, I greatly appreciate the help offered by my best working mentor/partner: 
[Mr. Tianqing Fang](https://github.com/tqfang) and the advisor when I was a junior in the NLP field: [Mr. Jiefu Ou](https://github.com/JefferyO). 

Further Research Achievements and Publications will be made available in the future.



## Research Interest

I'm mainly interested in the research of Natural Language Processing, with a special interest in exploring the following questions:

### **1. Commonsense Knowledge in Natural Language Processing:**
When human communicates, we rely on a vast background of unspoken assumptions. Everyone knows that "water is wet" and "we need food when we feel hungry", and we assume everyone we meet shares this knowledge. It forms the basis of how we interact and allows us to communicate quickly, efficiently, and with deep meaning.

However, current NLP models mainly relies on the explicit context information provided by some large corpus, how can we build deep learning models to efficiently and accurately learn the commonsense knowledge from large corpus? Even more, how can we achieve a highly adaptive and unsupervised NLP system with the help of commonsense learning?

### **2. Information Extraction and Graph Learning with Knowledge Graphs:**
The knowledge graph represents a collection of interlinked descriptions of entities – objects, events or concepts, they put data in context via linking and semantic metadata and this way provide a framework for data integration, unification, analytics and sharing.

With the development of graph algorithms, some graph neural networks demonstrated high performance in learning knowledge graphs. How can we design and implement more complicated graph learning algorithms to better extract the knowledge in knowledge graphs? And how can we bridge the gap between different knowledge graphs to generate more explicit or discourse knowledge?

### **Beside the above topics, I'm also actively participating researches in:**
* Computer Vision with a specific on video action recognition
* Machine learning based data mining with the combination of other field's knowledge such as environmental and atmospheric data.
