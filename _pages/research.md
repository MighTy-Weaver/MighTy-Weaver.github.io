There is no doubt that each research opportunity has brought me different aspects of harvest and growth.
**I would like to thank all the professors and PhD/MPhil students for providing me with the research opportunities and hand-on experiences below.**

*Remarks:*
- The researching projects below are listed by their starting time.
- Some researches below may lead to publication related works, for details of my publications, please go to [this page](https://mighty-weaver.github.io/publications/).

## 1. **NLP Related Projects**
### *(Supervisor: [Prof. Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/), HKUST, Jan. 2021 - Now)*

* Details of this research project will be made public once available. 

## 2. ***DISCOS*: Bridging the Gap between Discourse Knowledge and Commonsense Knowledge**
### *(Supervisor: [Prof. Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/), HKUST, Sep. 2020 - Dec. 2020)*

* We propose an alternative commonsense knowledge acquisition framework **DISCOS** *(from DIScourse to COmmonSense)*, which automatically mines expensive complex commonsense knowledge from more affordable linguistic knowledge resources. 
* Experiments demonstrate that we can successfully convert discourse knowledge over eventualities from [ASER](https://hkust-knowcomp.github.io/ASER/), a large-scale discourse knowledge graph, into inferential if-then commonsense knowledge defined in ATOMIC without any additional annotation effort. 
* Further study suggests that **DISCOS** significantly outperforms previous supervised approaches in terms of novelty and diversity with comparable quality.
* Accepted by *The Web Conference, 2021 (WWW2021)*.

## 3. **Data-driven Smart Assessment of Room Air Conditioner Efficiency for Saving Energy**
### *(Supervisor: [Prof. Zhongming Lu](https://facultyprofiles.ust.hk/profiles.php?profile=zhongming-lu-zhongminglu), HKUST, Jun. 2020 - Jan. 2021)*

* We present a *machine learning approach* to identify non-inverter window air conditioners with *low efficiency* using climate data and smart meter data from the university student hall rooms.
* First, we applied the XGBoost method to estimate the hourly electricity consumption of an air conditioner with input features including the number of people in the room, outdoor weather, and the operation of air conditioners in previous hours.
* Second, we examined the impact of outdoor temperature on the XGBoost prediction of hourly electricity consumption of air conditioners using the Shapley Additive Explanation method.
* Our result shows that the accuracy of XGBoost is 50~70% in estimating the hourly electricity consumption within a 10% error deviation range from the actual data.
* We conclude that the AC is highly efficient if the predicted hourly electricity consumption increases as the outdoor temperature rises. In contrast, the AC efficiency is rated low-efficiency if the change of outdoor temperature does not affect the prediction of the hourly electricity consumption. This conclusion is further verified by the AC replacement record.

## 4. **Web-Porting and Optimization of an outdated Terrain Toolkit** 
### *(Supervisor: [Prof. Raymond Chi-Wing Wong](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~raywong/), HKUST, Jun. 2019 - Dec. 2019)*

* Self-learnt some knowledge in HTML5 and PHP and JavaScript, port an outdated (Some OS not supported) program into a web-application.
* Increased new functions of uploading terrain file to the server and use the toolkit with uploaded file.
* Re-implemented the shortest distance calculating algorithm with improved performance in a large terrain.
