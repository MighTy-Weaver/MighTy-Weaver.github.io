There is no doubt that each research opportunity has brought me different aspects of harvest and growth.
**I would like to thank all the professors and PhD/MPhil students for providing me with the research opportunities and hand-on experiences below.**

*Remarks:*
- The researching projects below are listed by their starting time.
- Some researches below may lead to publication related works, for details of my publications, please go to [this page](https://mighty-weaver.github.io/publications/).

## 1. **TO BE STARTED SOON**
### *(Supervisor: [Prof. Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/), HKUST, Jan. 2021 - Now)*

* This project is currently at initial phase, it will be updated once confirmed.

## 2. **Contrastive-Learning Based Video Action Recognition**
### *(Supervisor: [Prof. Qifeng Chen](https://cqf.io/), HKUST, Dec. 2020 - Now)*

* This project aims to improve the accuracy of video action recognition by improving some state-of-the-art contrastive learning techniques, I have just started it since Dec. 2020, detail will be upload once achieved.

## 3. ***DISCOS*: Bridging the Gap between Discourse Knowledge and Commonsense Knowledge**
### *(Supervisor: [Prof. Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/), HKUST, Sep. 2020 - Dec. 2020)*

* We propose an alternative commonsense knowledge acquisition framework **DISCOS** *(from DIScourse to COmmonSense)*, which automatically mines expensive complex commonsense knowledge from more affordable linguistic knowledge resources. 
* Experiments demonstrate that we can successfully convert discourse knowledge over eventualities from [ASER](https://hkust-knowcomp.github.io/ASER/), a large-scale discourse knowledge graph, into inferential if-then commonsense knowledge defined in ATOMIC without any additional annotation effort. 
* Further study suggests that **DISCOS** significantly outperforms previous supervised approaches in terms of novelty and diversity with comparable quality.
* ***Remark: The paper is published in Arxiv preprint and is under review at The Web Conference, 2021 (WWW2021)***

## 4. **Data-driven Smart Assessment of Room Air Conditioner Efficiency for Saving Energy**
### *(Supervisor: [Prof. Zhongming Lu](https://facultyprofiles.ust.hk/profiles.php?profile=zhongming-lu-zhongminglu), HKUST, Jun. 2020 - Jan. 2021)*

* Processed and Compiled over 1.5 million environmental and atmospheric data with data-analysis tools.
* Implement several machine-learning algorithms to predict the AC energy consumption with given data and select the one with higher accuracy (XGBoost), algorithms include SVM, LSTM, XGBoost, MLP.
* Build XGBoost models for 134 different datasets, do feature engineering, parameters tuning and cross-validation to increase the model accuracy by 30%. 
* Implement an optimized SMOTE algorithm which helps solve the imbalance data distribution problem without marginalization.
* Use Shapely Additive Explanation to interpret the 134 models, identify the relation behind and identify the inefficient air-conditioners between rooms.
* ***Remark: The paper will be submitted to Applied Energy, 2021 Soon***

## 5. **Web-Porting and Optimization of an outdated Terrain Toolkit** 
### *(Supervisor: [Prof. Raymond Chi-Wing Wong](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~raywong/), HKUST, Jun. 2019 - Dec. 2019)*

* Self-learnt some knowledge in HTML5 and PHP and JavaScript, port an outdated (Some OS not supported) program into a web-application.
* Increased new functions of uploading terrain file to the server and use the toolkit with uploaded file.
* Re-implemented the shortest distance calculating algorithm with improved performance in a large terrain.
