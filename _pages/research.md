There is no doubt that each research opportunity has brought me different aspects of harvest and growth.

**I would like to thank all the professors and PhD/MPhil students for providing me with the research opportunities and hand-on experiences below.**

Some researches below may lead to publication related works, for details of my publications, please go to [this page](https://mighty-weaver.github.io/404.html).

## 1. **Improvement on Contrastive-Learning Based Video Action Recognition**
### *(Supervisor: [Prof. Qifeng Chen](https://cqf.io/), HKUST, Dec. 2020 - Now)*

## 2. **Bridging the Gap Between Two Knowledge Graphs**
### *(Supervisor: [Prof. Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/), HKUST, Sep. 2020 - Nov. 2020)*

* This project is mainly bridging the gap between two knowledge graphs, details of this project will be made available once allowed.

**Remark: This work is leading to a publishable work, it will be updated once accepted.**

## 3. **An application of smart meter data: Identification of inefficient air-conditioners by XGBoost model and Shapely Additive Explanations**
### *(Supervisor: [Prof. Zhongming Lu](https://facultyprofiles.ust.hk/profiles.php?profile=zhongming-lu-zhongminglu), HKUST, Jun. 2020 - Jan. 2021)*

* Processed and Compiled over 1.5 million environmental and atmospheric data with data-analysis tools.
* Implement several machine-learning algorithms to predict the AC energy consumption with given data and select the one with higher accuracy (XGBoost), algorithms include SVM, LSTM, XGBoost, MLP.
* Build XGBoost models for 134 different datasets, do feature engineering, parameters tuning and cross-validation to increase the model accuracy by 30%. 
* Implement an optimized SMOTE algorithm which helps solve the imbalance data distribution problem without marginalization.
* Use Shapely Additive Explanation to interpret the 134 models, identify the relation behind and identify the inefficient air-conditioners between rooms.

**Remark: This work is leading to a publishable work, it will be updated once accepted.**

## 4. **Web-Porting and Optimization of an outdated Terrain Toolkit** 
### *(Supervisor: [Prof. Raymond Chi-Wing Wong](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~raywong/), HKUST, Jun. 2019 - Dec. 2019)*

* Self-learnt some knowledge in HTML5 and PHP and JavaScript, port an outdated (Some OS not supported) program into a web-application.
* Increased new functions of uploading terrain file to the server and use the toolkit with uploaded file.
* Re-implemented the shortest distance calculating algorithm with improved performance in a large terrain.
