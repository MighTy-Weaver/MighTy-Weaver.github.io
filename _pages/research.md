There is no doubt that each research opportunity has brought me different aspects of harvest and growth.
**I would like to thank all the professors and PhD/MPhil candidates for providing me with the research opportunities and
hand-on experiences below.**

*Remarks:*

- The researching projects below are listed by their starting time.
- Some researches below may lead to publication related works, for details of my publications, please go
  to [this page](https://mighty-weaver.github.io/publications/).

## 1. **Final Year Thesis**

### *(Supervisor: [Prof. Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/), HKUST, Sep. 2021 - Now)*

* Details of this research project will be made public in the future.

## 2. **NLP Research Project**

### *(Supervisor: [Prof. Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/), HKUST, Jul. 2021 - Now)*

* Details of this research project will be made public in the future.

## 3. **Sustainable Smart Campus Project**

### *(Supervisor: [Prof. Zhongming Lu](https://facultyprofiles.ust.hk/profiles.php?profile=zhongming-lu-zhongminglu), HKUST, Jun. 2021 - Now)*

* Details of this research project will be made public in the future.

## 4. **Benchmarking Commonsense Knowledge Base Population with an Effective Evaluation Dataset**

### *(Supervisor: [Prof. Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/), HKUST, Jan. 2021 - Sep. 2021)*

* In this paper, we benchmark the CSKB population task with a new large-scale dataset by first aligning four popular
  CSKBs, and then presenting a high-quality human-annotated evaluation set to probe neural modelsâ€™ commonsense reasoning
  ability. We also propose a novel inductive commonsense reasoning model that reasons over graphs.
* Published in *The 2021 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP2021)* (Main Conference).

## 5. ***DISCOS*: Bridging the Gap between Discourse Knowledge and Commonsense Knowledge**

### *(Supervisor: [Prof. Yangqiu Song](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~yqsong/), HKUST, Sep. 2020 - Dec. 2020)*

* We propose an alternative commonsense knowledge acquisition framework **DISCOS** *(from DIScourse to COmmonSense)*,
  which automatically mines expensive complex commonsense knowledge from more affordable linguistic knowledge resources.
* Published in *The Web Conference, 2021 (WWW2021)*.

## 6. **Data-driven Smart Assessment of Room Air Conditioner Efficiency for Saving Energy**

### *(Supervisor: [Prof. Zhongming Lu](https://facultyprofiles.ust.hk/profiles.php?profile=zhongming-lu-zhongminglu), HKUST, Jun. 2020 - Aug. 2021)*

* We present a data-driven framework to identify non-inverter window room air conditioners with low energy efficiency by
  analyzing smart meter data from the university student hall rooms.
* Published in *Journal of Cleaner Production (JCLEPRO)*.
